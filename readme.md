# Kikketer Sencha Plugins

Here are a list of plugins developed by Chris Weed and Kevin McDonald.  We have found these to be useful, feel free to modify
them and contribute.

Documentation for each plugin is located inside the folder itself, but here's a quick overview:

## BtnNavigationBar
A navigation bar that will allow you to move the logic of the upper buttons into the view itself.

## iOSSelectField
An iOS7 themed select field.  We attempted to immitate the iOS7 second page instead of the built in scrollers that come with Sencha Touch 2.3

## Compatibility
These plugins have been tested working with Sencha Touch 2.3.1.
